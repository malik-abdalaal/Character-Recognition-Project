# Character-Recognition-Project
Project Description:
The provided code consists of two parts. The first part generates letter images and saves them as JPEG files. It uses the generate_letter_image and generate_text_image functions to create images of individual letters and text, respectively. The generated images are saved in the "images" directory using different fonts. The second part of the code involves training a character classification model and evaluating its performance.
